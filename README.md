# MERN Backend API

This is a Node.js + Express backend with authentication and CRUD operations.

## Features
- User registration and login
- JWT authentication
- Protected routes
- Resource management (CRUD)

## What I Will Build Later
I will convert this backend into a full MERN project. My plan is to build:

**Product Inventory App**  
A dashboard where users can:
- Login
- Add products
- Track inventory
- Edit and delete items

## Tech Used
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JWT Authentication
